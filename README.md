# PetFinder
* PetFinder is an ASP.NET MVC web application created for Telerik Academy. Its main goal is to be the ultimate online place for Bulgaria to search for your lost pet or to tell that you have found someone else's pet. The project's architecture relies heavily upon [Nikolay.IT's template](https://github.com/NikolayIT/ASP.NET-MVC-Template). 
The requirements for the project could be seen [here](https://github.com/TelerikAcademy/ASP.NET-MVC/tree/master/Final%20Project/2016)
